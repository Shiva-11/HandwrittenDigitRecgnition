# Handwritten Digit Recognition-Infosys Springboard Internship Project

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based approach for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, featuring a convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate classification. Additionally, the model is tested with the USPS dataset to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

## Features

- **Train a CNN model** using the MNIST dataset.
- **Save and load the trained model** as `mnist_model.h5`.
- **Test the model** on additional datasets, such as USPS.
- Perform **inference on custom handwritten digit images**.
- End-to-end implementation suitable for deep learning beginners.
