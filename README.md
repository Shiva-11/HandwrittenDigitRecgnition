# HandwrittenDigitRecgnition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset, built with TensorFlow and Keras. This project includes training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, saving it as `mnist_model.h5`, and testing it with additional datasets like USPS. It features end-to-end implementation for beginners in deep learning and computer vision.
